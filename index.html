    <p>Effective altruism is about doing the most good you can. This might be through donating to charities who have demonstrated their effectiveness or it might be through choice of career. It's a loose movement of people guided by evidence rather than their gut.</p>

    <p>1971: The seeds were sown by Peter Singer's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm">Famine, Affluence and Morality</a>.
    <blockquote class="quote" cite="https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm">If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.</blockquote>Taking this idea to it's logical conclusion, Singer suggests that we ought to give until we reach the level of <span class="tooltip">marginal utility<span class="tooltip-text">The point at which, by giving more, one would experience as much suffering as the beneficiary would avoid</span></span>.
    <p>The rise of charity evaluators has made it easier to decide where to give based on evidence.</p>

      <h3>big players:</h3>
      <p>Since 2007, <a href="http://www.givewell.org" target="_blank">GiveWell</a> has been making it easier to decide where to give by providing in-depth research and analyses of charities. In 2015 they estimate to have moved $110,135,779 to their top picks<a href="#3" class="ref">[3]</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org" target="_blank">Giving What We Can</a> launched in 2009, and now has 2,716 members who have donated a total of $22,242,740. Each member pledges to give 10% of their income, amounting to an estimated <div class="tooltip">$1.3 billion<span class="tooltip-text">Based on members' current age and their own estimates of their future salary</span></div> pledged so far<a class="ref" href="#4">[4]</a>.</p>
      <p>Taking a gentler approach, <a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/" target="_blank">The Life You Can Save</a> suggests pledging a minimum of 1% of your income, scaling it up for those with larger salaries. Their 18,798 members are estimated to have donated $1.35 million to highly effective charities in 2015<a href="#5" class="ref">[5]</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://80000hours.org/" target="_blank">80,000 hours</a> helps people find careers where they can do the most good. As of 2015 they led to 188 significant career changes based on their research<a href="#6" class="ref">[6]</a>.</p>

      <h3>your opportunity</h3>
      <blockquote class="quote" cite="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/#your-opportunity">Imagine if, one day, you saw a burning building, kicked the door down, ran in and rescued a small child. You’d feel like a hero — it would be one of the most important days of your life. What the evidence shows is that you can do that, every one or two years, for the rest of your working life.</blockquote>
      <p>The average salary in the UK is £26,468<a class="ref" href="#14">[14]</a> - within the richest 3% globally. 10% of this is enough to save <span class="tooltip">1 life per year<span class="tooltip-text">GiveWell's estimated cost per life saved by mosquito bednets is $1981</span></span>, and you'll still be in the richest 4%.</p>

      <h3>career</h3>
      <p>Most people have about 80,000 working hours in their lifetime. This provides a massive potential to do good. For some people this will mean doing good directly, e.g. as a doctor or working for a non-profit. For others it will be less direct such as through research, advocacy or earning to give<a href="#7" class="ref">[7]</a></p>

      <p>You see a burning building. Inside there's a <span class="tooltip">picasso painting<span class="tooltip-text">'Women of Algiers' sold in 2015 for £115m/$179m.

    <h3>Is effective altruism ineffective?</h3>
    <p>People give less when shown statistics about suffering compared to an <span class="tooltip">anecdote<span class="tooltip-text">This is known as the 'indentifiable victim effect'.</span></span>. In fact people even give less when shown both rather than just the anecdote. Could effective altruism lead people to donate less, albeit more effectively?<a href="#13" class="ref">[13]</a></p>
