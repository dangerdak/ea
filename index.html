    <p>Effective altruism is about doing the most good you can. This might be through donating to charities who have demonstrated their effectiveness or it might be through choice of career. It's a loose movement of people guided by evidence rather than their gut.</p>

      <p>Making a difference is about more than what you do directly. It's about the things you do which wouldn't have happened otherwise. If you work for in a highly competitive field such as charity work, it's likely that the next best applicant for your jobs will be nearly as good as you. If for instance you work in finance it's unlikely that the next best applicant would give a significant portion of their salary to charities.
